### QDD to MAJCOM
- [ ] _Scope Summary_ Ending balance of 4510 + 4610 = _Distribution to MAJCOM_ **Adjusted QDD**
    - The total **Adjusted QDD** column should equal the Ending Balance sum of 4510 and 4610 in-scope amounts on the Scope Summary tab, as well as the same two totals on the Distribution to MAJCOM tab.  (Ending Balance Totals only)
QDD still being worked by SAF/FM, so DFAS did not have these numbers to include in recon
- [ ] The totals for Import (green), JV (yellow) and combined (blue), Adjusted….
    - should equal the FD2M Recon numbers right next to it.  
    - Differences noted if applicable.
 QDD still being worked by SAF/FM, so DFAS did not have these numbers to include in recon 
- [ ] Using the QDD Breakdown by AU table, 
    - check the total “Distribution to MAJCOM” In Scope + Out of Scope totals for this quarter.  
    - It should equal the Total Distribution to MAJCOM from Level 2 QDD further down the tab.
